## What I Like

### ✅ Deep Customization & Flexibility  
Jira allows full customization of workflows, issue types, permissions, and processes — ideal for teams that need structure, governance, and specific workflows.

### ✅ Powerful for Larger / Process-Heavy Teams  
For teams doing complex projects, releases, or needing reporting and integrations — Jira scales well and offers control that simpler tools lack.

### ✅ Huge Ecosystem & Community Support  
Because Jira is so widely used, there are tons of integrations, plugins, community knowledge, and flexibility to expand functionality (reporting, CI/CD, time-tracking, etc.).

## What Could Be Better / Tradeoffs

### ⚠️ Steeper Learning Curve & Complexity  
Because of Jira’s flexibility and breadth of features, setup and onboarding can take time compared to lighter tools.  

### ⚠️ UI & Speed Sometimes Feel Heavy  
For small teams or simple workflows, the overhead of configuration and navigation might be too much.  

### ⚠️ Can Become Overkill for Simple Projects  
If you don’t need complex workflows, permissions, or reporting — Jira may feel heavyweight compared to simpler project tools.
